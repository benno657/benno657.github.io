# Thoughts on what functionality to include in the website

As i work on multiple projects in multiple fields is have to prioritize what i want, so lets do that!

## ChatGPT

Both integration and explenation of good practices.
Talking to people i have noticed that most common folks are quiet uninterested (understandably), and some other firends at uni talk about how they use it every day. Yet most people using it a lot seem to have a hard time geting the most out of it, or even a lot. One firend in particualr explained it like they were fighting it daily, trying to strangle answers out of it in order to get even a little bit of usefull information. 

It reminds me a lot of what Jorges Luis Borges wrote about the library of babel; a library that contains every book that has ever been or ever will be written, but since it contains all possible combinations of letters, words and sentences, it is impossible to find something meaningfull. Ecpecially something usefull.

It feels like a realization of Jorges thought experiment... Filtering out the worst gibberish, making people lower their guard and then hit them with the most absurd and nonsensical things. 

Luckily thats not remotly close to my experience! Apparantly i speant so much time experimenting with it i acualy got a grasp of how to navigate the thing. Ive already started working on a guide for that, *a hitchhikers guide to the library* of sorts. 

Untill then, ill leave this quote from my friend:

## Guides

Guides for days!

## A place to document my projects

A simple way of documenting my projects, with a simple way of adding new projects. I want to be able to add new projects with a simple command, and have the project automatically added to the website. I also want to be able to add new content to the project, such as new posts, with a simple command.

## Jupyter notebooks

I love that, its so simple! Just simple markdown text but with functionality that makes a calculator drown in its own tears.

---

## 3d-models

Using Shapr3d and Fusion 360, having a way to display 3d-models would be nice. Especially in a interactive way, saw somethin similar on the Flipperzero website and was impressed.

---

## A database?

Don't really know what i would use it for, but i would like to get into databases, so why not? Maby something that resembles a swedish 'nyckelbok' used by biologists to identify species. That would be both fun and cool to build.
