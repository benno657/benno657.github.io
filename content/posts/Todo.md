# Thoughts on what functionality to include in the website

As i work on multiple projects in multiple fields is have to prioritize what i want, so lets do that!

---

## A place to document my projects

A simple way of documenting my projects, with a simple way of adding new projects. I want to be able to add new projects with a simple command, and have the project automatically added to the website. I also want to be able to add new content to the project, such as new posts, with a simple command.

## Jupyter notebooks

I love that, its so simple! Just simple markdown text but with functionality that makes a calculator drown in its own tears.

---

## 3d-models

Using Shapr3d and Fusion 360, having a way to display 3d-models would be nice. Especially in a interactive way, saw somethin similar on the Flipperzero website and was impressed.

---

## A database?

Don't really know what i would use it for, but i would like to get into databases, so why not? Maby something that resembles a swedish 'nyckelbok' used by biologists to identify species. That would be both fun and cool to build.
